# Mixture-of-Robust-Gaussian-Processes
- Step 1. Download the gpml-matlab-v4.2-2018-06-11 toolbox from http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/.
- Step 2. Modify the paths (MGP_path and GPML_path) in MRGP.demo according to
your settings.
- Step 3. Run MRGP_demo.m

Notes:
1. You may change dataset path at Line 10 and Line 29 of MRGP_demo.m
2. The results obtained by this program may not exactly equals to the results
   presented in the paper due to randomness.
3. The real-world datasets have been re-scaled.
